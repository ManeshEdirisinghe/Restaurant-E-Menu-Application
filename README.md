To run this project, you need to have the backend server running first.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js** (v14 or higher) installed.
2.  **The Backend API:** You must clone and run the original backend server.

### Step 1: Start the Backend Server

This frontend relies on the `json-server` from the original repository.

```bash
# Clone the backend repository (if you haven't already)
git clone [https://github.com/ManeshEdirisinghe/Restaurant-E-Menu-Application.git](https://github.com/ManeshEdirisinghe/Restaurant-E-Menu-Application.git)

# Go to the backend folder
cd Restaurant-E-Menu-Application

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the API server (runs on port 3001)
npm run api
